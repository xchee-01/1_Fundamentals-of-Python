# Foundation in Python 

## Why Python?
- High-level, interpreted programming language
- Extensive library support, especially for scientific computing (BioPython, NumPy, Pandas)
- Large bioinformatics community
- Easy to learn and read

## Installation Steps
1. Software 
For this course, we would be using ANACONDA. You can download the Distribution [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

2. Learning materials
All learning materials would be available here in GitHub. You can access the learning materials [here](https://github.com/xchee-01/Python)

3. Supporting software
You should also download Notepad++ [here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

## Python Development Environments

Python development environments are software tools that provide everything you need to write, test, and debug Python code efficiently. This can be divided into two types, namely Python Interpreter and Integrated Development Environments


1. Python Interpreters
Python interpreters are good for quick testing. They can be accessed via terminal/command prompt:

```
python
>>> print("Hello")
Hello
>>> exit()
```

2. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

(a) PyCharm
Full-featured IDE
Great for large projects
Built-in debugger


(b) VS Code
Lightweight
Excellent Python extension
Good for multiple languages


(c) Jupyter Notebooks (**This is what we would be using in this course**)
Perfect for data analysis
Interactive cells
Popular in bioinformatics
